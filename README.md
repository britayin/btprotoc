# btprotoc

**btprotoc** is a compiler for proto files. The proto file is compiled into a `.h` file consisting of simple enumerated types.
It was used in the process of code simplification (PBCodec) and de-c (OCS). It has been used in mobile QQ.

If you just need to compile the proto file into the `.h` file, you can use the compiled `btprotoc.jar` directly.

Compile a file or all the `.proto` files under a folder.
```
java -jar btprotoc.jar    file(folder)    [output dir]
```
